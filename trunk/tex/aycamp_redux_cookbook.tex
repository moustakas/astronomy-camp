Cookbook for reducing imaging and spectroscopy taken during astronomy
camp using IDL:

I am assuming that you're working from an astronomy-camp computer that
has been set up with all the requisite IDL libraries (e.g., apollo).
Log into the machine and be sure you have all the following
IDL environment variables set.  For example, in tcsh you need [look at
  my .tcshrc file]

Preliminaries:

Your data should be organized on a night-by-night basis.  Make a new
directory called 'Raw' and move all your raw data (or, better yet, a
copy of your raw data) into that directory and gzip.  For example,
your directory structure for two night's worth of data might look
like:

mydata
  21jun2009
    Raw
  22jun2009
    Raw
