#summary How to reduce an ARO 12m on the fly map,
#labels radio

= Introduction =

This procedure needs to be run on the observer computer in the ARO 12m (remotely is fine). Change target names as appropriate.

The scripts referred to below, and called with {{{@P:}}} are located on modelo in: */home/obs/GAG/*

= *Details* =

In terminal:
{{{
otf2class -bs # -es # -i (1 or 2) -s 10 -d -o /home/obs/ _directory_ _filename_
}}}
where {{{bs}}} and {{{es}}} are the beginning and end scan numbers.

Open {{{class}}} from command line and 
initialize with {{{@P:startx}}}
The print from this command should include the following glossary of shortcuts:
{{{
symbol mx "las\set mode x"
LAS_3> symbol my "las\set mode y"
LAS_3> symbol ss "las\SET Source"
LAS_3> symbol sl "las\set line"
LAS_3> symbol ssc "las\set scan"
LAS_3> symbol so "las\set off"
LAS_3> symbol b1 "las\base 1"
LAS_3> symbol sw "las\set window"
LAS_3> symbol fi "las\file in"
LAS_3> symbol fo "las\file out"
LAS_3> symbol st "las\set telescope"
}}}


to select backend use "set telescope" or "st", i.e. {{{st 12m-Mac}}}.
{{{
file in class_010.12m

ss "nameofsource"
set number 533 624
}}}
for example, files look like: 
_class_006.12m through class_009.12m_
% so need to run sequence on each and then combine.

%1st for each file convert the on the fly file to a class file. specify 1st record and last, use backend 3 and 4 and debug and put in the aac folder:
{{{
otf2class -bs 1953 -es 1960 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_006
otf2class -bs 1962 -es 2043 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_007
otf2class -bs 2045 -es 2126 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_008
otf2class -bs 2131 -es 2212 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_009
}}}
%skipped @scaleall and @P:baseallkill since they seemed superfluous.

%In class:
{{{
fi class.sdd_fb21.aac_006
find
list
}}}
%define a window, use fact that  VLSR is x km/s:

To preview the first profile and determine the window, get a record, view the header and plot:
{{{
get 1
header
plot
}}}

%could use base all kill but don't need to, channels look ok and can window out.

{{{
@P:baseall
% (if no bad channel)
J=1
%created:
w3irs5_006.base.base
w3irs5_007.base.base
w3irs5_008.base.base
}}}

complete data range:
{{{
mx -400 300
}}}

window including line window:
{{{
sw -100 0.
}}}


A quick sequence might look like:
{{{
ss “nameofsource”
find
list
sw (block out line and bad channels)
mx -10 28
@P:baseallkill (if bad channel)

}}}
The {{{convall}}} script will ask for the following parameters:
{{{
lmin -210 #MIN RA offset (in units of ARCSEC) 
lmax 210 #MAX RA offset (in units of ARCSEC) 
bmin -300 #MIN Dec offset (in units of ARCSEC)
