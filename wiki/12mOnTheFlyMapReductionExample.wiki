#summary How to reduce an ARO 12m on the fly map,
#labels radio

= Introduction =

This procedure needs to be run on the observer computer in the ARO 12m (remotely is fine).
See also: [http://aro.as.arizona.edu/docs/analysis_manuals.htm]

= *Details* =
initialize with @P:startx
to select backend use "set telescope" or "st", st 12m-Mac*

file in class_010.12m

ss "NGC5461"
set number 533 624


for example, files look like: *w3 irs5 n2h+ files are:*
class_006.12m through class_009.12m
% so need to run sequence on each and then combine.

%1st for each file convert the on the fly file to a class file. specify 1st record and last, use backend 3 and 4 and debug and put in the aac folder:
otf2class -bs 1953 -es 1960 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_006
otf2class -bs 1962 -es 2043 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_007
otf2class -bs 2045 -es 2126 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_008
otf2class -bs 2131 -es 2212 -i 3 -d -o /home/obs/aac/ sdd.aac_009

%skipped @scaleall and @P:baseallkill since they seemed superfluous.

%In class:
fi class.sdd_fb21.aac_006
find
list
%define a window, use fact that  VLSR is -40:

%could use base all kill but don't need to, channels look ok and can window out.

@P:baseall
% (if no bad channel)
J=1
%created:
w3irs5_006.base.base
w3irs5_007.base.base
w3irs5_008.base.base
!!!!!!!still need to run on 009!!!!!!!!!!
